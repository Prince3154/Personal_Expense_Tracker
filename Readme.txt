A simple command-line tool to manage and track your personal expenses. This Python-based application allows you to add expenses, view detailed summaries with visual representations, and delete unwanted expenses. It supports saving and loading expenses in both CSV and JSON formats.

Expenses are stored in CSV or JSON formats. The application automatically loads expenses from expenses.csv upon startup and saves any new changes upon exit. You can also switch to using a JSON file by updating the filename in the code.
